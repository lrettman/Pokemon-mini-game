Pokémon Battle Workshop is a simple text-based battle simulation written in Python.
Players can choose a starter Pokémon — Charmander, Squirtle, or Bulbasaur — and face off against a wild Pikachu in a turn-based combat sequence inspired by the Pokémon games.

The game lets players attack, use potions, view Pokémon, or run away from battle.
Choose between three starter Pokémon.

Randomized attack and healing values for replayability.

Turn-based combat system.

Basic inventory with limited potion use.

Win or lose based on HP (Health Points).
